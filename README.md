# Pythagorean-Calculator
This is a program I have built using Python. 
This repository contains both the code and the application. This application helps to solve difficult problems in Mathematics using Pythagoras.
This application can be really helpful to find missing measures of sides of a right-angled triangle by using Pythagoras. Which works really like a magic!
Hope you find this helpfulðŸ˜Š!
